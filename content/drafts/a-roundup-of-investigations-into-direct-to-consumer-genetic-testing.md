Earlier this week, the Oversight and Investigation subcommittee of the
Energy and Commerce committee of the US House of Representatives
undertook an investigation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing. To some,
this investigation was long overdue; to others, it was a witch hunt by
intrusive regulators. In any case, it's pretty clear that this event
will lead to regulatory oversight that will permanently shape genetic
testing. Below, I've provided a few links with comments and highlights.

First, a brief reminder of some of the recent travails of DTC testing.
In June 2008, the California Department of Public Health sent a
["Notice to Cease and Desist Performing Genetic Testing Without Licensure or Physician Order"]
(http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/files/madrigal.PDF) to
several DTC companies. In the summer and fall of 2009, deCode,
Navigenics, and 23andme contended with financial problems and layoffs
that were widely perceived as a ["refudiation"]
(http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/07/quote-2.html>)
of our readiness to transform genomic data into clinically actionable
information or to make this information personally intriguing. (Yes,
there are examples of both; I mean that DTC does not appeal *broadly*
for either use -- yet.) Then, in October 2009, an
[An agenda for personalized medicine](http://http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812653>)
made the shortcomings of DTC testing very public. On May 19, the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on `Oversight and Investigations
asked three prominent DTC companies to provide information
(http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2009:committee-investigates-personal-genetic-testing-kits&catid=122:media-advisories&Itemid=55>). On
June 8, 2010,
[23andme officially responded](http://spittoon.23andme.com/2010/06/08/update-from-23andme/)
to reports that 96 patient samples had been mixed up by LabCorp, its
CLIA-certified subcontractor. Customers received test results that
were not theirs, presumably leading to at least a few cases of swapped
grief and relief about genetic predispositions. ((Clearly the bulk of
the blame rests with LabCorp, but 23andme apparently had insufficient
data analysis quality control (through, say, variants that would
corroborate gender) to detect this themselves before results were made
available to consumers.)) The [FDA notified five companies on June 10]
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/default.htm)
and
[another 14 on July 19](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/ucm219582.htm>)
that effectively declare an intent to regulate genetic testing (see
the excellent analyses by Dan Vorhaus on
[the first five](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/06/11/what-five-fda-letters-mean-for-the-future-of-dtc-genetic-testing/)
and the
[the 14 more](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/07/21/14-more-fda-letters/>).

With this background, the House Commerce and Energy Committee meeting
was a set up for a tough day for DTC testing. There are many great
sources of information and commentary. I particularly like the
[Genomics Law Report](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/),
[Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/), and `
[Genetic Future](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/) blogs, which
often have links to source data.  Here are some critical links that
cover the pro-regulation and laissez-faire viewpoints:

   <dd>The GAO, with their
   [2010 report on deceptive marketing practices](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-847T)
   and the audio recordings of  telephone counseling, provided
   damaging testimony that will make nearly everyone's jaw drop. Think
   traveling salesmen with hair tonics 100 years later. If you think
   these were the just the small players, think again: A counselor at
   Navigenics was caught on tape saying "you’d be in the high risk of,
   you know, pretty much getting [breast cancer]". Don't miss the
   explosive audio transcripts (3 minutes) of DTC telephone counselors
   with undercover customers to see exactly how bad this can get. Also
