protobuf
swagger
capnproto
msgpack

=> whoa. backup: what do I want?

figure
client, server, models,
conceptual models => code and serializations
multi serializations in json, xml, pb, msgpack, etc
validation
reasonable code

federated sources
NOT single-source! so passe!

model -> {doc,lang models,db models,wire models} + codegen



* clear usage modes/models
iterative builds


* swagger
- no enums
- annoyance bugs and gap between suggested features and real-world
-

* protobuf
- fugly code


What's needed:
- schema validation
- two-sided models
- client-server tests
