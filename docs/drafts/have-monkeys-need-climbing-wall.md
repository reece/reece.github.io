I have three kids. All of them like to climb. Margot seems unnaturally
compelled to climb things -- no matter how imprudent. (She broke her
clavicle at age 2 after climbing up to, and falling off of, the
kitchen table.) Unfortunately, our San Francisco postage stamp yard
has no good places to climb. Since I spent most of my childhood in a
tree, the lack of climbable structures for my kids disturbed me. So,
during a recent break between jobs, I built a climbing wall in our
house. The kids love it and it was a hit at our recent holiday cookie
party.

[Here are a few pictures](https://goo.gl/photos/8YH9m2A88wtySLov8) of
the final product.
